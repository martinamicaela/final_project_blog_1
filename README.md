<h1>Decor Statement</h1>

<img src="readmephotos/landingpage.png" alt="home page landing page first time">

<h2>Introduction</h2>

This is a full-stack framework project built using Django, Python, HTML and CSS. My goal is to create a functioning and responsive website, that allows the admin user to post, and users can create an account and leave a review on the existing posts.

## User Experience Design

Target audience:

Young and middle age adults, mostly couples and women, who are planning on buying a house or renovating their homes. 

This website intends to inspire and give fresh ideas to users. It also wants to become a mean of entertainment bringing new decor trends and useful tips.

- The target audience will expect: 

   -intuitive navigation.  

   -An informative website, with information that is easy-to-find & concise.

   -Ability to review and rate posts.

   -Ability to make a user account in order to interact with the site content



## Admin credentials
- admin: admin1 ,  password: decortest1simple
- normal user: Emily, emily@email.com  password: 1passtest 

## Landing page for first time users

The landing page allows users to see a display with all the posts ordered in chronologically way, being the closest one, the first appearing on the top of the page.

Besides, right at the top the users can see the logo of the page with a sophisticated design, with a navbar  next to it, that contains the main sections of the site: Home, Register and Login. Alonside with the navbar, on the opposte side of the page the user can find the footer with the links to social media platforms and the name of the developer who worked on this project.

## Home page (Site Logo)

The first element that the user sees when visiting site, is the logo: Decor Statement in deep, dark purple underlined font. 

- User experience in the Logo section: 

  - The selection of size, colour and type of font, 
 helps the user to identify quickly the name of the site.

  - The name of the site "Decor Statement" indicates clearly that this is a website related with home decor. In addition, the name statement indicates that this web intends to highlight or propose different decor styles. 
  
  - Thanks to the Logo the user would feel captivated with  positive attitude even before checking the rest of the page.

## Home page (Posts) 

The Home page focuses mainly on the display of the posts, as we mentioned before the posts appeared ordered in time. The main features that can be highlighted are:

-The first element is a photo with the name of the author under it, just before the title of the post.

- The name of the post is as well a clickable button for the user. 

- Under the post name, the user can read an excerpt and 
 see the date of publication.  

- User experience in the events section: 

  - The selection of size, colour and type of font, 
 helps the user to identify quickly the name of the post and differentiate it from the excerpt.

## Home page (Navbar and foooter) 

Apart from the events, section the Home page also provides the user with a useful navbar and a informative footer. The navbar is divided into three main areas of interest; Home, Register and Login and the footer proportionate information of interest about the developer that worked on this project. The main features that can be highlithed are:

- The clickable sections in both, the navbar and the footer 

- The colour animation when the user hovers over the clickable parts.

- The change in the cursor icon when the user hovers over the clickable parts.

- User experience in the navbar and footer section: 

  - The selection of size, colour and type of font, 
 helps the user to identify quickly the different sections that can be found on the navbar.

  - The colour transition animation in the navbar and the footer, as well as the change in the cursor icon, both give clear indications about the clickable property of the elements in these sections. Besides, they produce an eye-catching effect on the user when these elements are hoovered over, creating the need for clicking and a sense of mystery.

  - The Git hub cat icon in the footer,  gives important visual information about, social media links and the developer.

## Posts page (Posts) 
The Posts page focuses mainly on the display of a single post. The main features that can be highlighted are:

-The first element is a photo with the title of the post next to it.

- The content of the post. 

- Under the post there is a section in which the user can check the product its price and the store that sells the product through a clickable button.

- Right after the user can see the section review with its ratings.  If the user is logged in there is also a form on the other side of the page so a review can be created if desired. 

- User experience in the events section: 

  - The selection of size, colour and type of font, 
 helps the user to identify quickly the name of the post and differentiate it from the content.

  - The user can see the hyperlink in blue which links to the item proposed by the post, so that the user does not need to look for it online. 

   - Once the form is filled out the user can see a modal of success or a notification with a error, a user can also checked if the state of the review as if appears on a faded colour and with a messaged if it has not been approved yet. As well te user can update and delete reviews.

## Design Choices

### Fonts 

Grey Qo was chosen as a more interesting font that would give character to the page. It was sourced from [here](https://fonts.google.com/share?selection.family=Grey+Qo|Neuton:ital,wght@0,200;0,300;0,400;0,700;0,800;1,400|Nixie+One)

I selected the font style Nixie One for the titles and Times New Roman for the content of the posts. Times New Roman is a popular font widely used in the world of press, it is clear and elegant.


### Colours

I selected sophisticated and elegant design with a delicate an atemporal palette.This palette has accent tones such as dark purple or slate blue but also brings harmony with french grey and linen.

### Database

I tried to plan out the models before hand to avoid having to do migrations mid-project. I tried to work out the field types, one-to-many, PK or FK etc.
